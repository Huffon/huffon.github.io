Hi, I am Hoon Heo, a graduate student.

I have a high interest in Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning. So, I am studying my Master's degree in Deep Learning & NLP area @[**Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico**](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/pt/).


I love AI since through this technology, We can make a better world!

In the future, I want to become a researcher or professor. And, I want to be a positive leader who can shine a younger generation :)

Hi, I am Hoon Heo, an undergraduate student.

I have a high interest in Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning. So, I plan to study my Master's degree in Deep Learning & NLP area.


I love AI since through this technology, We can make a better world!

In the future, I want to become a researcher or professor. And, I want to be a positive leader who can shine a younger generation :)


I studied Software Convergence and Portuguese and graduated from [Hankuk University of Foreign Studies](http://hufs.ac.kr) in 2019.

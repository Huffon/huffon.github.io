일반적을 성공한 스타트업들의 행보는 대개 두 분류로 나뉜다. '스케일업(Scale-up)' 혹은 '엑시트(Exit)'. 여기서 스케일업은 말 그대로 규모를 키우는 것이다. 포르투갈 내에서의 성공을 기반 삼아 주변 국가로 영역을 넓혀 나가는 방식이다. 그리고 엑시트는 창업자가 스타트업을 일정 수준으로 성장시킨 다음 대기업에 파는 것을 의미한다.

'유니플레이스(Uniplaces)'와 '토크데스크(Talkdesk)'는 스케일업을 이뤄낸 스타트업이다. 유니플레이스는 지난 2011년 설립된 회사로 유럽에 2만여 개의 부동산을 확보, 학생들을 위한 주거공간을 제공하는 온라인 시장을 만들었다. 이 플랫폼을 통해 세계 165개국의 학생들이 단 세 번의 클릭만으로 유럽 40여 개 도시에서 주택을 임차할 수 있게 됐다. 유니플레이스는 2015년 스카이프(Skype) 창립자로부터 2200만달러의 자금을 투자받기도 했다.

Uniplaces는
Uniplaces is an online marketplace for booking student accommodation. Based in Lisbon, the platform was founded in 2012 by Miguel Amaro, Mariano Kostelec and Ben Grech. As of October 2015, students from over 140 countries have booked with Uniplaces for a total of more than 500,000 nights.

The platform’s name is derived from “university” and “places”, abbreviated to “Uniplaces”.

Uniplaces was founded in 2012 by Miguel Amaro, from Portugal, Ben Grech, from England, and Mariano Kostelec, from Argentina, having its headquarters in Lisbon and an office in London.

The three co-founders met at the University of Nottingham and at King's College London, and first came up with the concept in the Summer of 2011. In November 2011, they participated in Lisbon’s Startup Weekend and created the first version of the platform.[2]

By the beginning of 2012, after a positive response, the trio built a fully working version of the website and secured several partnerships with universities in Portugal.[3]

After having hired a new Head of Design in 2014, Uniplaces unveiled its new website on 7 March 2015, featuring an entirely redesigned branding and logo.

In May 2015, Martin Reiter, former VP at Airbnb, joined Uniplaces as an investor and advisor to help the company expand internationally.[4] 2015 also marked the launch of the Uniplaces Scholarship[5] and the Uniplaces Guarantee,[6] as well as a partnership with Google

2013 marked the company’s expansion to Porto and London, and later on, in May 2014, to Madrid.[8] After raising its third investment round, in October 2014, Uniplaces rapidly expanded to 39 cities in 8 countries across Europe by April 2015.

Uniplaces completed a €200k seed round from a group of top European investors in July 2012.[9] Included in the deal were Portugal’s top angel fund Shilling Capital Partners as well as Alex Chesterman one of the UK’s most successful internet entrepreneurs, having founded Zoopla.co.uk and LOVEFiLM.com, and William Reeve who co-founded LOVEFiLM.com.[10][11]

Uniplaces secured a second seed round in 2013, bringing in a further investment of €1M by British VCs (and Octopus Holdings Limited subsidiary) Octopus Investments.[12]

In October 2014, Uniplaces completed its first Series A round, raising €3M from its previous investors, as well as former Managing Director at Barclays Capital, Rob McClatchey.[13]

On 3 November 2015, during Web Summit, Uniplaces announced a €22M Series A round at Google HQ, in Dublin. This round was led by Atomico, and counted with previous investors Octopus Investments and Shilling Capital Partners.
